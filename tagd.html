									A portable laser tag system with a textile twist!
								</p>
							</header>
							<p>
								For our Fourth Year Design Project, our team wanted to do something that was fun and nostalgic. Birthday parties held at bowling alleys, indoor putting and laser tag were a staple of each team member's childhood - which led us to the concept of portable laser tag! The team latched onto this idea quickly and were teeming with proposals on how we can re-interpret the traditional equipment in a more convenient package.

											A staple of laser tag is the bulky hardware that each player is saddled with. We wanted to do away with the large shooters and heavy vests - but how can we shoot without a shooter? Our solution was to repackage the shooter into a glove - each player will be armed with a shooter glove. With one hand acting as a "pistol", we felt that it would be appropriate to bring the <strong>cops and robber</strong> vibe to another level. The glove detects a <strong>trigger</strong> action and fire off a laser pulse in the aimed direction.
										</p>
										<p>
											In the first several brainstorming sessions, the team worked on a one-handed shooting gesture and designed our first prototype using flex sensors. After testing a variety of flex sensors, we concluded that the sensors were not slow and damaged very easily. It was not difficult to reinforce the shooter glove, but this was neither comfortable nor practical as the glove had to be flexible but could not be folded and damaging the flex sensors.
										</p>
										<p>
											Going back to the drawing board, the team narrowed down a pose that felt natural and deliberate - a two-handed shooting gesture. We reworked the concept a couple times and found that conductive fabric made a great textile capacitive sensor; it was always responsive and detected touches instantaneously. We were really happy with our final prototype - it's simple yet intuitive, aspects of invisible design that we didn't expect to acheive.

									<h2>Make-Or-Break: A Lightweight, Flexible Laser Detection Sensor</h2>
								</header>
								<div class="row">
									<div class="8u 12u(mobile)">
										<p>
											Our next (and biggest) hurdle to tackle was to slim down the detection sensors that our players would wear. The majority of our project was spent on developing an <strong>all-textile</strong> sensor patch. The panels must be rugged, reliably detect laser pulses but still remain comfortable and lightweight.
										</p>
										<p>
										   At the start of our project, we consulted a number of professors who specialized in optics. The professors suggested the use of amorphous silicon and amorphous germanium sensors - cutting-edge, next-generation flexible light sensors. Unfortunately, these sensors are highly expensive to create and have only been tested in research labs. Going with amorphous sensors was not a viable option; it would cut down our project to a proof-of-concept and we were committed to building a practical product. 
										</p>
										<p>
										  The team tested numerous lasers against numerous combinations of flexible solar panels, reflective fabrics and stage lighting colour filters during our prototyping stage. We eventually stumbled upon <strong>fibre optic fabric</strong> which we found worked great as a textile light transfer medium. After months of R&D, we had done it - We developed a fairly low-tech, truly wearable sensor patch!

											The final component of the tag'd system is the base station. This is the heart of tag'd - it is responsible for setting up an arena, communicating with vests, creating matches, enforcing gameplay rules and generating live scoreboards.
										</p>
										<p>
										  A <strong>XBee</strong> antenna allows for wireless communication between each vest and the base station. From our own testing, we were able to achiever an arena of roughly 85 ft radius (direct line-of-sight) for gameplay.
										</p>
										<p>
										  The base station also creates a <strong>local WiFi</strong> network where its game portal can be accessed from any mobile device. Using the portal, users can configure the gameplay mode (Capture the Flag or Free-For-All), manage settings and view score breakdowns.
										</p>
										<p>It wouldn't be a truly portable system if users have to fiddle with settings on their device all day. With a basic three-button and LCD interface, players can simply drop the base station and start a match - anytime, anywhere!
